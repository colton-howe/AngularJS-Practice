What is this
--------------
Small login page that I made for a job interview test that combines AngularJS and Node. 
Definitely very helpful in getting more used to Angular, and learned a few more things
about Node.

How to Run
--------------
This application uses Node, so installing Node and npm is required.

If you are on Windows, this is a nifty link about how to install.

If you are on Linux, here is your nifty link

Once you have Node and npm installed, I have included a package.json file that contains
all the dependencies needed. You just need to simply call the command "npm install" from
inside the directory of the package.json file, and it will install all the dependencies 
for you.

After that, you just need to run the command "node server.js" while located in the directory
of the server.js file. Everything should run from there!
